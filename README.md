This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This project is a boilerplate integrated with Shopify's Storefront API to serve as an e-commerce boilerplate.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Shopify
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_SCHEMA_URL="{YOUR STORE URL}"
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN="{YOUR TOKEN}"
# Algolia
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID="{YOUR_APP_ID}"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_API_KEY="{YOUR_KEY}"
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
